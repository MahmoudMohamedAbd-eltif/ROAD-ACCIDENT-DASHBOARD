# Road Accident Dashboard Analysis (Microsoft Excel)

## Project Overview
This project delivers a comprehensive, interactive dashboard built entirely within **Microsoft Excel** for analyzing road traffic casualty data. The primary objective was to transform a large, complex dataset into clear, visually accessible, and actionable insights.

The dashboard effectively visualizes key metrics, focusing on the severity of casualties, location type (Urban/Rural), road surface conditions, and temporal trends across the monitored period.

## Methodology and Key Tools
The dashboard was developed by leveraging Excel's advanced data handling capabilities:

* **Tools:** Microsoft Excel (specifically Pivot Tables, Slicers, and advanced charting).
* **Techniques:** Data aggregation via Pivot Tables, implementing interactivity through Slicers, and applying custom formulas for derived metrics.

## Project Context and Learning
This dashboard serves as a direct, practical application of techniques learned from an excellent, step-by-step tutorial. The project was instrumental in strengthening my skills in complex data modeling and professional dashboard design within Excel, demonstrating a strong ability to learn from and apply expert-level external resources.

## Key Insights and Analysis

The analysis of the dataset (totaling **417,883 casualties**) reveals critical findings:

* **Severity Distribution:** 84.1% of all casualties were classified as 'Slight,' highlighting the need to address the high frequency of minor incidents.
* **Location Impact:** Accidents in Urban areas significantly outweigh Rural incidents, accounting for over 61% of total casualties.
* **Road Condition:** The majority of accidents occurred on Dry road surfaces, suggesting that factors other than weather and surface grip are the dominant contributors to road safety issues.
